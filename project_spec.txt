Equipment Rental Management System – Project Document
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Title: Equipment Rental Management System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The traditional equipment rental process is largely manual and inefficient. Customers must physically visit rental offices or make phone calls to check equipment availability. Rental records are maintained using paper registers or spreadsheets, leading to errors, data loss, and double bookings. Billing is handled manually, increasing the risk of miscalculations. Additionally, there is no real-time system to track equipment status or rental history.
3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
The proposed system is a web-based application that allows users to browse available equipment, check rental prices, and place rental requests online. Administrators can manage equipment inventory, approve rental requests, track equipment returns, and handle payments through a centralized dashboard. The system provides real-time availability updates and automated billing to improve accuracy, efficiency, and transparency.
4. USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS

C. Equipment Manager (Operational Role):
