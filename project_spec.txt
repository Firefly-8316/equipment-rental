Equipment Rental Management System – Project Document
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Title: Equipment Rental Management System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

The traditional equipment rental process is mostly manual and inefficient. Customers must visit rental offices or make phone calls to check equipment availability. Rental records are maintained using registers or spreadsheets, which leads to errors, data loss, and double bookings. Billing is done manually, increasing the chances of miscalculations. There is no real-time system to track equipment status or rental history.

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION

A web-based application that allows users to browse available equipment, check rental prices, and place rental requests online. The admin can manage equipment inventory, approve rentals, track returns, and handle payments through a centralized dashboard. The system provides real-time availability updates and automated billing to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
